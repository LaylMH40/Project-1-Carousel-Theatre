# Wireframes for Carousel Theatre Project
These were initial designs created with the user experience and user stories in mind. The designs changed slightly, with some aspects being omitted (e.g. the coming soon section) because they were found to be cumbersome to the website and reduced the user experience. Other changes include the moving around and refining of these designs.
