# Carousel Theatre Website
---
A website designed to bring an old theatre into the new world. The Carousel Theatre now turned cinema website allows users to learn about the theatre, find out important information (i.e. where it is, opening times, showing films) and allows site users to book tickets.

### Business Goals
For this project, there are 2 main business goals.
- The first is to sell tickets to film showings
This is the primary purpose of the website. A place for users to purchase tickets. We have ensured this by the inclusion of the booking page and booking form. We have also minimalised of steps to purchase, ensuring there will be less users who abandon purchase due to long forms aka bad user experience. 
To encourage users to book tickets, there is a separate page of Current Showings. On this page, users can view images and read descriptions of the films which the theatre is currently showing. Alternatively, users may wish to book tickets by phone or in-person. They can do so by visiting the Homepage of the Carousel Theatre website. Included is a brief biography of the theatre, opening times, landline phone number and location. 
- To regain returning custom
This goal is less straightforward. We can attempt to say this will be achieved due to the standard of User experience on the site. This undoubtedly will play a part in return custom. However, this also has a lot of other determining factors which are not linked to user experience of the site, e.g. the user's experience of the theatre offline, the array of movies currently showing, etc. 

### User Experience

### Highlights of the User Experience
- The form 'Book Now!' button sends you to a Thank you page. This is good UX because it means the user doesn't have to press the 'go-back' button.
- The consistent styles across the pages of the site ensure a consistently good user experience.
