# Testing 
In this section, I will be testing my site. 

## Code validation
First thing I did when testing my code was to run it through code validators (html and css respectively. 
### HTML code
- Multiple errors found on initial pass through the official W3C validator
- 1 error remains for booking.html, method attribute of form is blank.
Since I am not sending the booking form data anywhere for this project, I thought it would be okay to leave the method attribute blank for the form. post or get? one of these
### CSS code
- 2 errors regarding a media query appeared upon the initial validation check through the official Jigsaw CSS Validator
- removed media query and now have 0 errors.

## User Stories and Testing
### User Story 1 - User would like to learn key information about the theatre
- This can be achieved easily as the homepage shows all key information about the theatre. 
- Phone number is highlighted to draw the users eye
- Location information is aided by a Google maps iframe which allows the user to stay on the site without needing to go search the address in another browser tab.
### User Story 2 - User would like to know What is Currently showing? Which film should the user watch?
- This can be achieved by clicking the 'Current showings' tab on the navigation bar. This is available on every page so the journey to the page is simple. 
- Candidate can view movie posters, descriptions and reviews
### User Story 3 - User would like to Navigate the site easily.
- This can be achieved by using the navigation bar, which is present on every page and runs the full width of the site. 
- The background of the navigation links change color when hovered over, to allow the user to see what they are selecting
Please see the screenshot below displaying this information.
### User Story 4 - User would like to book tickets easily.
- This is achievable because the booking form is available as soon as you click onto the site, and as part of the navigation bar it is available across ALL pages.
- The single page booking form allows for a simple booking experience, with one submit button ensuring users will not have time to abandon purchase.
### User Story 5 - User would like to use the site on their mobile phone
- This is achievable because I have used the bootstrap column sysem. This system allows easily applied responsiveness. 
- All elements of the site are available on the desktop, tablet AND mobile viewpoints.
- When the site goes to fit the smallest screen-size, the information present on the sight moves into a single column for ease of use on smaller screens.
