# Testing 
In this section, I will be testing my site. 

## Code validation
First thing I did when testing my code was to run it through code validators (html and css respectively. 
### HTML code
- Multiple errors found on initial pass through the official W3C validator
- 1 error remains for booking.html, method attribute of form is blank.
Since I am not sending the booking form data anywhere for this project, I thought it would be okay to leave the method attribute blank for the form.
### CSS code
- 2 errors regarding a media query appeared upon the initial validation check through the official Jigsaw CSS Validator
- removed media query and now have 0 errors.
