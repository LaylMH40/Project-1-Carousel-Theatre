# Project Title - Carousel Theatre Website 
## Project Description - 
A website designed to bring an old theatre into the new world. The Carousel Theatre now turned cinema website allows users to learn about the theatre, find out important information i.e. where it is, opening times, showing films and allows site users to book tickets.


## User Experience

### Business Goals 
For this project, there are 2 main business goals. The first is to sell tickets to film showings, to gather more interest to the theatre. To approach the first goal there is the option to Book tickets on the site. There is a form present which requires the user to fill in all relevant information to purchase tickets. There are checkboxes for the user to select number of tickets and radio buttons to select the film showing, date and time. To ensure ease of use, all of the ‘Book Now’ form is on one page ending with a ‘Book Now’ button. The minimalisation of steps to purchase ensures there will be less users who abandon purchase due to user experience. To encourage users to book tickets, there is a separate page of Current Showings. On this page, users can view images and read descriptions of the films which the theatre is currently showing. For desktop viewers, reviews from staff members of the films are available to view. 
Alternatively, users may wish to book tickets by phone or in-person. They can do so by visiting the Homepage of the Carousel Theatre website. Included is a brief biography of the theatre, opening times, landline phone number and location.
To approach the second goal of gathering more interest for the theatre, I have included a ‘Coming Soon’ section to the footer of the website. I added this to the footer to ensure that it was present on each page and that when users thought there was nothing else to the page there was the intrigue of future film showings. The main homepage also aids the mission to gather further interest in the theatre as it provides all information needed for a user to visit, contact and learn about the business.
### User Goals
As this is a business concerned with sales from the users of this site, the business goals and user goals interject. Namely, the business goal of selling tickets comes face-to-face with the user goal of wanting to buy tickets. Because these goals are adjacent in nature, the input they have on the coding of this site is similar. The entire booking form being on one page is beneficial in terms of UX and fulfils the user goal. It also fulfils the business goal because it is good UX. Users are more likely to return to this site to book tickets because it is quick and easy to use. A further user goal is to learn key information about the theatre, i.e. location, opening times, currently showing etc. To ensure this need was met, the entire homepage is dedicated to providing this information. Convenient location information in the form of a google maps iframe ensures users can interact with the map and see how far it is from their home without exiting the site. Additionally, the inclusion of idyllic images of the (imaginary) theatre ensure that users will recognise the venue if/when they decide to visit. Another user goal is to know what films are showing and how much tickets are. Users can find an entire page of the site dedicated to ‘Current Showings’, where they can read descriptions of the films and see the advertising posters. Then, on the booking page the price of tickets is very noticeable as it is brightly coloured BLANK, ensuring it won’t be missed! This is essential to user experience because it ensures that users do not feel uncertain about the costs and then dejected from purchase.

## Deployment 
A step by step of how to deploy ur project 
A step by step of how to run it in a coding environment (gitpod)
Document the steps needed to clone, install and run ur code 

## Testing
Ensure all of your site works, write about how you have tested the site 
The responsiveness, the browser compatibility
Go back over user stories in detail and talk about how your site meets these pre-identified needs and wants 
Remember to use online validators for your languages 
Testing - Bug section 
Any major bugs etc 

Major bug: all radio buttons on form would coincide so you couldnt pick a date and time, only a date OR time. managed to change around the bootstrap applied IDs and it ened up working when i had personalised them :)

Major bug: styles.css was having no effect! turns out href wasincorrect, it was href="styles.css" but shouldve been href="css/styles.css"

Using the Nav bar & links in the footer users can navigate to each of the pages, also by clicking on the Carousel theatre heading the user is redirected to the Homepage. 

Users on desktop can see reviews of the films currently showing.

I have used HTML and CSS languages to create this webpage. To aid my work I have used Bootstrap to input the basic stylings and HTML layout. 

 Reflection & Challenges: I underestimated the amount of work and time required for this project and in the future will be allotting plenty of more time to complete the project.
